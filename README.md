Supercharge your new Material-UI project with Mui Treasury Layout.

v4 just came out in May 2020 with whole new cool stuffs.

- Reduce JS calculation and leverage css-in-js for server side rendering (no more blip at first paint)
- Keep the library lean as much as possible. Get rid of lodash and don't rely on specific css-in-js lib (jss is still used internally in Material-UI, so we cannot remove it)
- Improve developer experience by rewriting with typescript and design new API
- Add more documentation & troubleshoot requested from developers (thanks everyone)
- Reduce bundle size and make it tree shakeable!

## Get started 🚀

If you never used Gatsby before, I highly recommend you to [Set up your development environment](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/)!

open terminal and go to directory you want to create your project, run this command to clone and install:

```bash
$ gatsby new my-layout https://github.com/mui-treasury/gatsby-mui-layout-starter
```
> `my-layout` will be the name of your project and folder, you can to whatever you want

Run the project and see the result in http://localhost:8000/ 😃

```bash
$ yarn start
```
